liquid for-loop,Brian,695470,847538,Pick the Best Product Group,Iterate through a cell and populate it as separate items in your UI,"Your gonna wanna take a seat for this. Imagine you've got a bunch of data in 1 cell. Why only have 1 item in a cell when you can have bunch? Its a party in that cell. But here's the stinker, when you upload the cell into CF, all those sweet items are gonna get vomitted onto the UI as just one blob of data. Pffff.....No thanks! But heres the answer, For Loops! Liquid for loops to be exact. By implementing a terrific for loop into your design (and splitting your data in the UI) you can split up each item into its own space in the ui? Say what? you heard me right, take your data, split up into multiple items, and friggin display it in your job. Have fun tracking down your socks cuz they just got knocked Off!!",https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdflower-make-cloud/images%2F1469141280635-Screen+Shot+2016-07-21+at+3.47.26+PM.png,:(,This is the best thing since slided bread! and I'm a baker so that's saying something,cool_js

Columns, headers, rows, lines, you know what I'm talking about. But let's say in your data you got some holes? Like made for some columns you don't have info for every row. An example that comes to mind is a good ol fashion business listing csv. You got some business names, phones, nubmers and some address info. But! maybe you don't have the zip for all the business because some intern slacked off?? What you gonna do just display the data as 'No Data Available' in the job UI? You'll be the laughing stock of the contributor community! Save your self the embarrasment, by using some liquid condionals so that zip won't display if its missing. It's like Magic!!!",https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdflower-make-cloud/images%2F1469141905361-Screen+Shot+2016-07-21+at+3.49.06+PM.png,:D,"Wow, this is exactly what I was looking for.
